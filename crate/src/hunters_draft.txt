all_moved_squads:
Create a vector with all squads that moved, and after collect all squads set was_moved to false

How hunters will work:
1. Go over all squads
2. When last aim position is different than current one
3. Collect all squads with aim, and group them by the same aim
4. Check if aim was moved significantly since last positions calc, if no, just omit this group an use old track
  4.1 also there is a case when track is calculated first time, then just treat it as moving enemy, and needs to calc track one more time
5. Calc new position
6. Calc new tracks for all squads which got a new position


How attack will works:
1. unit has to have reference to the aim


0. Calc new centers for all squads
1. Call hunters update
Problem is that user can move units, right after hunters will go over the squads, so was_moved = false for all
2. Update all_moved_squad (because 1. use that "was_moved" field, and here will be set to false always)
3. Update units/AI/squads/factions/factories
