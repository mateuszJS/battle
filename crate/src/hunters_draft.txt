How hunters will work:
1. Go over all squads
2. Introduce was_moved field to squad, will be set to true if any member was moved, as set to false for all squads after loop over hunters
3. Collect all squads from one faction, each squad with was_moved = true and squad have aim
4. Check distance to the target
5. If squad is in range, when stay and shoot (dumb way, cannot  place the units closer then (if many squads attack one aim))
6. If squad is out of range, then collect all these squads, and calc positon for them
7. loop over all positions, and calc track for each position

How attack will works:
1. unit has to have reference to the aim
